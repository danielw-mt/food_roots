/* Text Water is Wealth In Honolulu, environmental activists are seeking to remake their city according to Indigenous design knowledge. What is happening in Waikiki might be a model for a new watershed urbanism. The name Waikiki means “spouting waters,” a nod to the flowing waterways and rich farmland of taro, rice, and fishponds that in precolonial times characterized this landscape on the island of Oʻahu. 1 Today, Waikiki remains perhaps the best-known public place in Hawai‘i, yet its image in the popular imagination betrays none of this history. Instead, most Americans’ perceptions of the Hawaiian Kingdom remain essentially static, stalled in the year of Hawaiian statehood — 1959 — even as Waikiki Beach has continued to be shaped by hyper-global commerce. Waikiki stretches for less than a mile and a half on the southeastern shore of the archipelago’s most populous island, which is also home to the state’s capital city, Honolulu. Kalākaua Avenue, bordering the beach, is Honolulu’s fanciest shopping street, dense with tourist-centric development; the Hyatt, Marriott, and Sheraton hotels stand within steps of one another, flanked by high-end shops like Jimmy Choo and Fendi. The white noise of the ocean tempers the sound of traffic and the gentle if omnipresent tones of Hawaiian music, both live and recorded, emanating from the resorts. In the past fifteen years, Kalākaua Avenue’s 20th-century stalwarts have been upgraded to keep pace with this more recent development. The open-air, banyan-shaded International Marketplace re-opened in 2016 after a $500 million renovation; the landmark pink behemoth of the Royal Hawaiian and the colonial columns at Moana Surfrider have been brightened up. Sidewalks have been repaved with gleaming white flagstone. But walk a few blocks inland, and you are surrounded by midcentury mid-rise apartment buildings, their exterior walkways and lanais constructed of breezeblock and lava rock, untouched signage riveted to their walls — “Skyliner,” “Waikiki Winds,” “Pan Pacific.” Palms and banyans disappear along with the breeze, and heat rising from the concrete becomes more noticeable. A few blocks farther, and you’ll hit the stagnant waters of the two-mile-long Ala Wai Canal. The canal testifies to the persistence of another midcentury illusion; that is, that water can be effectively controlled through massive engineering projects. Construction on the Ala Wai, whose name translates as “waterway,” began in 1921 and was completed in 1928. The canal was built at the behest of the Territorial Board of Health to drain nineteen square miles, almost a third of urbanized Honolulu; it functions as an estuary to prevent flooding between the ocean and the termini of Oʻahu’s freshwater streams, which have mostly now been channelized and buried. When tides rise, salt and freshwater mix in the canal. With heavy rains come animal waste, trash, and surface pollutants from automobile traffic that wash in and stagnate, creating conditions under which bacteria like Vibrio vulnificus, a cause of life-threatening skin infections, can thrive. 2 As if all this weren’t worrisome enough in the era of climate crisis, a rising sea is encroaching from the beach side, while increased volumes of stormwater enter from the city side. The structural integrity of Ala Wai is emerging as a major concern for nearby residents and the Army Corps of Engineers alike. The future of Waikiki, in many ways the central image of the state, is tenuous. At the same time — as countless Native Hawaiian scholars, writers, storytellers, and activists have made clear over the past century — this thin strip of beachfront, like much of colonialized Hawaiʻi, was always a mirage. The merchants and military interests who advocated for draining the marsh and building the canal one hundred years ago did so on the pretext of protecting the public from miasmas and mosquitoes, although a more pressing interest was exploitation of oceanfront real estate. 3 The expansion of Waikiki and the building of the Ala Wai Canal accelerated development and catalyzed colonization on Hawaiian lands. Now this infrastructure has locked state residents in a stalemate between profit and sustainability. The struggle over the future of the Ala Wai Canal is, on the surface, an issue in urban water management. But it is also a microcosm for much larger questions about power, social justice, and the material legacies of colonization. Given the urgencies of our era, what happens in Waikiki in the coming years might serve as a model for other cities seeking infrastructural, social, and economic sustainability. Histories of 19th- and 20th-century urbanization tend to be predicated on capital and its efficiencies, favoring those whose financial and industrial resources allow them to literally reshape ground conditions to their advantage. From the point of view of industrialists and policymakers, the variability of landscape ecology and the longterm stewardship necessary to a thriving biosphere can seem inefficient or simply inconvenient; narratives of the American urban landscape too often emphasize the prowess of modern engineering, asking less frequently who holds the power to manipulate infrastructural capacities, separating technical achievement from its societal reverberations. Two decades into the 21st century, it’s not uncommon to hear that such long-held perceptions and practices are destabilizing under pressure from accelerating climate change, persistent issues in social and racial justice, and widening economic inequities. Whether this is true remains to be seen. Oʻahu measures just under 600 square miles and Honolulu is more than 2,500 miles from any other major city — a location that is obviously radically specific in its history and ecology. Yet the city’s remoteness and small size, as well as the particular violence of its colonial history, only intensify issues that many other cities will also have to confront in the near future.
