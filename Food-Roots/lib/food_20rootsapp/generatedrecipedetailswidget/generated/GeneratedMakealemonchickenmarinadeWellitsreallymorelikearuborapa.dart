/* Text Make a lemon chicken marinade. Well, it’s really more like a rub or a paste, because our lemon chicken recipe requires no actual marinating (yay!). But basically, we coat the chicken breasts in a thick, olive oil-based herb paste flavored with oregano, thyme, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Make the lemon chicken sauce! Stir together all of the zingy things - white wine, fresh garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice - to make the sauce that the chicken breasts will bake in. You’ll also use this sauce to baste the chicken as it bakes, ensuring that these bright flavors have a chance to be absorbed by the chicken (without having to actually marinate the chicken). Bake! Until you get that internal temperature reading of 165°F. Then it’s time to dig in!
